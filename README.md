#Book Tracker 
#Purpose
I have a lot of books I want to read, and I want a place to store them all. I also want to be able to see the genre and author. Once I have finished it or don't want to read it anymore, I want to remove it from the list. 

#Tech Stack 
I want to use Python for the backend and Javascript for the front.
